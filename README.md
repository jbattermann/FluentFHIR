# FluentFhir
A [fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) .Net client implementation of the [HL7](https://www.hl7.org/) [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) standard & specification (a.k.a. *Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources*, a standard for health care data exchange) [R4 / 4.0.0](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/history.html).

The [upcoming R5](https://onfhir.hl7.org/2019/01/20/fhir-r5-roadmap/) of the standard is still a year out but support for it is planned once the specification finalizes.
